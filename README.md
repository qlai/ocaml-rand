# ocaml-rand

## About

Some simple utilities for doing OpenSSL Tasks.

## Dependencies

Dependent on `x509`, `nocrypto`, `hex` libraries. Command-line interface generated using the latest release of `cmdliner`. Also requires `cstruct` and `extlib`.
These can all be installed using `opam` (although some may need to be pinned to main repos).

```
opam pin add "package" https://github.com/packagelink.git
opam install nocrypto x509 cstruct cmdliner extlib
```

## Notes
I am still working on the tools so this hasn't been packaged properly yet. However any feedbacks/suggestions are always welcome :)
